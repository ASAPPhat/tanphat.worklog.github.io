With Strands Agents, you can build production-ready, multi-agent AI systems in a few lines of code.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve continuously improved features including support for multi-agent patterns, A2A protocol, and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. You can use a collection of sample implementations to help you get started with building intelligent agents using Strands Agents. We always welcome your contribution and feedback to our project including bug reports, new features, corrections, or additional documentation.\nHere is the latest research article of Amazon Science about the future of agentic AI and questions that scientists are asking about agent-to-agent communications, contextual understanding, common sense reasoning, and more. You can understand the technical topic of agentic AI with relatable examples, including one about our personal behaviors about leaving doors open or closed, locked or unlocked.\nLast week\u0026rsquo;s Launches Here are some launches that got my attention:\nAmazon EC2 M4 and M4 Pro Mac instances – New M4 Mac instances offer up to 20% better application build performance compared to M2 Mac instances, while M4 Pro Mac instances deliver up to 15% better application build performance compared to M2 Pro Mac instances. These instances are ideal for building and testing applications for Apple platforms such as iOS, macOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS, visionOS, and Safari. LocalStack integration in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – You can use LocalStack to locally emulate and test your serverless applications using the familiar VS Code interface without switching between tools or managing complex setup, thus simplifying your local serverless development process. AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) Refactor (Preview) – You can rename constructs, move resources between stacks, and reorganize CDK applications while preserving the state of deployed resources. By using AWS CloudFormation\u0026rsquo;s refactor capabilities with automated mapping computation, CDK Refactor eliminates the risk of unintended resource replacement during code restructuring. AWS CloudTrail MCP Server – New AWS CloudTrail MCP server allows AI assistants to analyze API calls, track user activities, and perform advanced security analysis across your AWS environment through natural language interactions. You can explore more AWS MCP servers for working with AWS service resources. Amazon CloudFront support for IPv6 origins – Your applications can send IPv6 traffic all the way to their origins, allowing them to meet their architectural and regulatory requirements for IPv6 adoption. End-to-end IPv6 support improves network performance for end users connecting over IPv6 networks, and also removes concerns for IPv4 address exhaustion for origin infrastructure. For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What’s New with AWS? page.\nOther AWS News Here are some additional news items that you might find interesting:\nA city in the palm of your hand – Check out this interactive feature that explains how our AWS Trainium chip designers think like city planners, optimizing every nanometer to move data at near light speed. Measuring the effectiveness of software development tools and practices – Read how Amazon developers that identified specific challenges before adopting AI tools cut costs by 15.9% year-over-year using our cost-to-serve-software framework (CTS-SW).

Specialist SA, Serverless Amazon Web Services Key Highlights Identifying the drawbacks of legacy application architecture Long product release cycles → Lost revenue/missed opportunities Inefficient operations → Reduced productivity, higher costs Non-compliance with security regulations → Security breaches, loss of reputation Transitioning to modern application architecture – Microservices Migrating to a modular system — each function is an independent service communicating via events, built on three core pillars:\nQueue Management: Handle asynchronous tasks Caching Strategy: Optimize performance Message Handling: Flexible inter-service communication Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Four-step method: Identify domain events → arrange timeline → identify actors → define bounded contexts Bookstore case study: Demonstrates real-world DDD application Context mapping: 7 patterns for integrating bounded contexts Event-Driven Architecture 3 integration patterns: Publish/Subscribe, Point-to-point, Streaming Benefits: Loose coupling, scalability, resilience Sync vs async comparison: Understanding the trade-offs Compute Evolution Shared Responsibility Model: EC2 → ECS → Fargate → Lambda Serverless benefits: No server management, auto-scaling, pay-for-value Functions vs Containers: Criteria for appropriate choice Amazon Q Developer SDLC automation: From planning to maintenance Code transformation: Java upgrade, .NET modernization AWS Transform agents: VMware, Mainframe, .NET migration Key Takeaways Design Mindset Business-first approach: Always start from the business domain, not the technology Ubiquitous language: Importance of a shared vocabulary between business and tech teams Bounded contexts: Identifying and managing complexity in large systems Technical Architecture Event storming technique: Practical method for modeling business processes Use event-driven communication instead of synchronous calls Integration patterns: When to use sync, async, pub/sub, streaming Compute spectrum: Criteria for choosing between VM, containers, and serverless Modernization Strategy Phased approach: No rushing — follow a clear roadmap 7Rs framework: Multiple modernization paths depending on the application ROI measurement: Cost reduction + business agility Applying to Work Apply DDD to current projects: Event storming sessions with business teams Refactor microservices: Use bounded contexts to define service boundaries Implement event-driven patterns: Replace some sync calls with async messaging Adopt serverless: Pilot AWS Lambda for suitable use cases Try Amazon Q Developer: Integrate into the dev workflow to boost productivity Event Experience Attending the “GenAI-powered App-DB Modernization” workshop was extremely valuable, giving me a comprehensive view of modernizing applications and databases using advanced methods and tools. Key experiences included:\nLearning from highly skilled speakers Experts from AWS and major tech organizations shared best practices in modern application design. Through real-world case studies, I gained a deeper understanding of applying DDD and Event-Driven Architecture to large projects. Hands-on technical exposure Participating in event storming sessions helped me visualize how to model business processes into domain events. Learned how to split microservices and define bounded contexts to manage large-system complexity. Understood trade-offs between synchronous and asynchronous communication and integration patterns like pub/sub, point-to-point, streaming. Leveraging modern tools Explored Amazon Q Developer, an AI tool for SDLC support from planning to maintenance. Learned to automate code transformation and pilot serverless with AWS Lambda to improve productivity. Networking and discussions The workshop offered opportunities to exchange ideas with experts, peers, and business teams, enhancing the ubiquitous language between business and tech. Real-world examples reinforced the importance of the business-first approach rather than focusing solely on technology. Lessons learned Applying DDD and event-driven patterns reduces coupling while improving scalability and resilience. Modernization requires a phased approach with ROI measurement; rushing the process can be risky. AI tools like Amazon Q Developer can significantly boost productivity when integrated into the current workflow. Some event photos Overall, the event not only provided technical knowledge but also helped me reshape my thinking about application design, system modernization, and cross-team collaboration.\n"

	"content": "AWS Open Source Blog Strands Agents and the Model-Driven Approach by Arron Bailiss on 12 SEP 2025 in Artificial Intelligence, Open Source, Technical How-To Permalink Comments Share\nUntil recently, building AI agents meant wrestling with complex orchestration frameworks. Developers wrote intricate state machines, pre-defined workflows, and extensive error-handling code to shepherd language models through multi-step tasks. We needed to construct complex decision trees to handle cases of “what if the API call fails?” or “what if the user asks something unexpected?” Despite the effort, agents would break when they encountered unforeseen situations.\nThe Strands Agents SDK adopts a model-driven approach that eliminates this fragility entirely. Instead of trying to anticipate and program for every possible scenario, we let modern large language models self-steer their behavior, making intelligent decisions about tool usage and adapting flexibly to whatever happens. This approach is more durable, with better resilience because it allows models to reason about problems dynamically. When an API call fails, the model doesn’t crash – it reasons about alternatives. When a user asks something unexpected, the model doesn’t follow a pre-defined “I don’t understand” path – it figures out how to help, using the available tools. The model’s reasoning capability handles edge cases better than any state machine we could write.\nThe model-driven approach comes from the real-world experience of AWS teams building production agents for Kiro, Amazon Q Developer, and AWS Glue. What we discovered fundamentally changed how we thought about agent architecture: the orchestration frameworks we previously built to guide models were now getting in the way of what modern LLMs could do naturally.\nHowever, using the model as the orchestrator doesn’t mean sacrificing developer control. Strands offers a clean, simple interface that gets you started in minutes, while providing powerful configurability for when you need it. Integrated evaluation tools help you understand and validate the agent’s behavior, ensuring you maintain confidence even as the models make autonomous decisions. This balance of simplicity and flexibility is what makes the model-driven approach practical for both rapid prototyping and production systems. Strands grows with you.\nIn this post, we’ll explore how the model-driven approach emerged from real-world production experience and show you practical patterns for building agents that can think for themselves.\nWhen orchestration becomes a constraint Traditional agent frameworks emerged when language models needed a lot of hand-holding. Developers built complex state machines, pre-defined workflows, and intricate coordination logic because the models couldn’t reliably reason about their next steps. We would write hundreds of lines of code just to handle the flow between “gather information,” “analyze data,” and “provide response” – and still end up with agents that broke when users asked questions in unexpected ways.\nThe AWS teams I worked with to build Amazon Q Developer experienced this directly. Initially, we used traditional orchestration frameworks, but changes in product requirements and user behavior required significant scientific and engineering effort to calibrate the system to handle new use cases. Machine learning (ML) routers and classifiers would return brittle outputs for guardrails – static text like “I’m sorry, I cannot answer that question” – without offering alternatives or explanations in a way that was interactively helpful and appeared intelligent.\nModern models are sophisticated enough to orchestrate themselves. This was the critical insight that changed everything for us. While structured workflows still have their place – especially for compliance requirements or well-defined business processes – the model-driven approach eliminates the need for rigid orchestration in most scenarios.\nWhen the Q Developer teams transitioned to the model-driven approach, the system could flexibly handle changing product requirements and respond coherently no matter what happened. Instead of brittle guardrail responses, the agent could offer alternatives and use the guardrail’s output as context for the model to understand why it couldn’t answer certain inputs. This allowed for a single personality and tone across multi-agent systems, enabling engineers across Amazon to contribute their domain expertise while maintaining coherence. It also provided the right context to the model at the right time with powerful tools for helpful, intelligent responses.\nWhen you give a model tools, it doesn’t just mechanically execute them. It reasons about the best approach, considers multiple strategies, and adjusts its behavior based on what it discovers. A model analyzing a performance issue might start with system metrics, realize the true bottleneck is in the database, pivot to query analysis, and then propose both immediate fixes and long-term architectural improvements – all without being explicitly programmed for that sequence.\nThe operational benefits were transformative. What previously took months of development now took weeks. Our teams could rapidly leverage the latest Large Language Model (LLM) features like tool calling, expansive and interleaved thinking, multi-agent systems, meta agents, MCP, and A2A – all while keeping a simple developer interface that could be fully customized for deploying AI agents in production.\nThis philosophy extends beyond single agents. Whether you’re building a simple data analysis agent or a complex multi-agent system, the model decides when to collaborate with other agents, when to delegate tasks, when to dive deeper into a problem, and when to provide a final answer.\nThe agent loop: Where intelligence meets action The heart of this philosophy is the agent loop – a natural cycle of reasoning and action that mirrors how intelligent systems think and work. This approach builds on the ReAct pattern (ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models), which demonstrated how language models could generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, creating a greater synergy between thinking and acting.\nThe model engages in a continuous reasoning process, asking questions like:\n\u0026ldquo;What am I trying to achieve here?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What information do I need?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Which tool will be most effective?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How do these results change my understanding?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Should I continue exploring or provide an answer?\u0026rdquo;\nThis internal reasoning process is what makes model-driven agents powerful. They aren\u0026rsquo;t just executing pre-defined steps – they are thinking, adapting, and evolving their approach in real-time.\nGuiding intelligence through context While the model self-steers its behavior, that behavior is shaped by the context it receives. In the model-driven approach, you guide the agent’s intelligence not through rigid control structures, but through carefully constructed context that includes system prompts, tool specifications, and conversation history.\nThink of it like hiring a skilled consultant. You don\u0026rsquo;t micromanage their every step – instead, you give them clear objectives, explain what resources are available, and provide relevant background information. The model-driven approach works the same way.\nSystem prompts establish the agent’s role and objectives – they set the foundational identity and high-level goals that guide every decision-making process. Instead of dictating concrete steps, effective system prompts describe what success looks like and provide principles for decision-making. Instead of “First check the database, then validate input, then process the request,” you might write “You efficiently and accurately help users analyze their data, always validating input before processing.”\nTool specifications define the boundaries of capability and guide usage – they communicate not just which tools are available, but how and when they should be used. Well-designed tool descriptions become part of the model’s reasoning process. A tool description like “Use this tool for complex mathematical calculations that require high precision” helps the model appropriately choose between a calculator tool and writing Python code.\nConversation history maintains task continuity and evolving context – it provides the specific details that enable agents to maintain coherence across interactions. As conversations get longer, this context management becomes critical to maintaining performance while retaining relevant information. Context management is critical for model-driven agents – it is the difference between an agent that maintains coherent, intelligent conversations and one that loses track of crucial details or hits token limits. Strands provides a simple interface that allows developers to define the agent’s system prompts, tools, and context management behavior without getting lost in the complexity of implementation.\nSliding window approaches retain recent messages and discard older ones: simple and effective. Summarization techniques retain critical information from longer conversations within token limits – better for complex, evolving discussions. The goal is to provide the model with the most relevant context to make good decisions for your specific use case.\nThis represents a major shift from procedural programming to contextual programming. Instead of writing “if this, then that” logic, you are creating the context that helps the model figure out the best approach on its own.\nfrom strands import Agent\nfrom strands_tools import calculator, file_write, python_repl\nSimple: Get started in seconds agent = Agent(\ntools=[calculator, file_write, python_repl],\rsystem_prompt=\u0026quot;You are a helpful assistant that can perform calculations and verify them with code.\u0026quot;\r)\nThe model autonomously decides: calculate first, then verify with code agent(\u0026ldquo;Calculate the compound interest on $10,000 at 5% annually for 10 years\u0026rdquo;)\nThis design philosophy is carried throughout Strands. You can build complex agents without getting lost in configuration, yet every aspect remains customizable when your use case demands it.\nScaling model-driven agents with Strands The model-driven approach scales naturally while maintaining a clean developer experience. A single agent equipped with the right tools can handle complex tasks that would traditionally require multiple specialized components. When you do need multiple agents, the models coordinate themselves through several proven patterns. Strands offers four primary approaches for multi-agent coordination, each suited for different use cases:\nAgents-as-Tools: Hierarchical systems where specialists act as intelligent tools\nSwarms: Autonomous collaboration with self-organizing groups of agents\nGraphs: Structured workflows with defined execution paths\nMeta-Agents: Dynamic agents that can modify their own coordination behavior\nWhether you are building simple hierarchies or complex adaptive systems, Strands keeps the interface clean while providing the configurability needed for production systems.\nAgents-as-Tools: Hierarchical Intelligence When a single agent needs specialized expertise, agents-as-tools turn other agents into intelligent tools. This creates natural hierarchies where an orchestrator agent delegates to specialists, maintaining a clear separation of responsibility while leveraging the model-driven approach at every level. How does the orchestrator agent decide which specialist to consult? The model reasons about the request the same way it reasons about tool selection. When a user asks “Plan a business trip to Tokyo and research market opportunities there,” the orchestrator recognizes that this requires both travel planning and market research expertise. It might consult the travel advisor first to understand the logistics, and then use those constraints to guide the research analyst’s work.\nfrom strands import Agent, tool\n@tool\ndef research_analyst(request: str) -\u0026gt; str:\n\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Research specialist for market analysis\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\rresearch_agent = Agent(\rsystem_prompt=\u0026quot;You are a research specialist who gathers and analyzes market information.\u0026quot;,\rtools=[web_search, calculator]\r)\rreturn str(research_agent(request))\r@tool\ndef travel_advisor(request: str) -\u0026gt; str:\n\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Travel planning specialist for logistics and recommendations\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\rtravel_agent = Agent(\rsystem_prompt=\u0026quot;You are a travel planning specialist who helps with logistics, bookings, and recommendations.\u0026quot;,\rtools=[flight_search, hotel_search, weather_api]\r)\rreturn str(travel_agent(request))\rOrchestrator decides when to consult specialists and how to synthesize their input executive_assistant = Agent(\nsystem_prompt=\u0026quot;You coordinate with specialists to provide comprehensive assistance.\u0026quot;,\rtools=[research_analyst, travel_advisor]\r)\nThe orchestrator model decides which specialists to consult and how to synthesize their input – no pre-defined workflow is needed. This pattern works well when you need clear boundaries of expertise and want the models to delegate with a leading primary agent.\nSwarms: Autonomous Collaboration Swarms allow agents to collaborate autonomously in a self-organizing way, deciding when to hand off tasks to one another. This works well for creative collaboration and emergent problem-solving, where multiple perspectives add value.\nConsider a market research project where you need to analyze a new product opportunity. A traditional method might follow a rigid sequence: research → analyze → write. But real research is messier – you might discover during analysis that you need supplementary data, or realize while writing that a different analytical framework would be more compelling.\nfrom strands import Agent\nfrom strands.multiagent import Swarm\nresearcher = Agent(name=\u0026ldquo;researcher\u0026rdquo;, system_prompt=\u0026ldquo;You research topics thoroughly\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;)\nanalyst = Agent(name=\u0026ldquo;analyst\u0026rdquo;, system_prompt=\u0026ldquo;You analyze data and create insights\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;)\nwriter = Agent(name=\u0026ldquo;writer\u0026rdquo;, system_prompt=\u0026ldquo;You write comprehensive reports\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;)\nAgents coordinate autonomously through model-driven handoffs market_research_team = Swarm([researcher, analyst, writer])\nIn a swarm, the researcher might start gathering information, then hand off to the analyst when they’ve found interesting patterns. The analyst might spot gaps and hand back to the researcher for more specific data. The writer might join the conversation early to help shape the research direction based on what will make a compelling story.\nThe key difference from agents-as-tools is shared context. In hierarchies, the orchestrator decides what information is passed between specialists. In swarms, all agents have access to the same conversation history, allowing for more fluid collaboration and high-level instructions. You can tell a swarm “research this market opportunity” without specifying exactly how the work should be divided – the agents figure it out themselves based on their shared understanding of the evolving task.\nSwarms trade predictable execution for emergent capabilities, making them ideal for complex research tasks, brainstorming sessions, and creative projects where the best approach isn\u0026rsquo;t clear at the outset.\nGraphs: Structured Workflows Graphs provide defined workflows where execution follows pre-determined paths. While the individual agents within a graph use model-driven execution, the graph structure ensures specific sequences and dependencies are maintained.\nThis pattern excels for business processes that require mandatory checkpoints or compliance requirements. For instance, a financial analysis process might require research → risk assessment → regulatory review → final proposal, with each step building on the last and some steps requiring specific sign-offs.\nfrom strands import Agent\nfrom strands.multiagent import GraphBuilder\nbuilder = GraphBuilder()\nbuilder.add_node(researcher, \u0026ldquo;research\u0026rdquo;)\nbuilder.add_node(analyst, \u0026ldquo;analysis\u0026rdquo;)\nbuilder.add_node(writer, \u0026ldquo;report\u0026rdquo;)\nbuilder.add_edge(\u0026ldquo;research\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;analysis\u0026rdquo;)\nbuilder.add_edge(\u0026ldquo;analysis\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;report\u0026rdquo;)\ngraph = builder.build()\nAWS teams have used graphs to orchestrate data pipelines, where certain transformations must happen in sequence, and for compliance processes, where audit trails require specific step-by-step documentation. The model-driven approach still applies within each node – the research agent can adjust its methodology based on what it discovers – but the overall flow remains predictable.\nThe trade-off for graphs is their rigidity. If the analyst discovers they need supplementary research, they cannot directly request it – the workflow would need to complete and potentially restart. This makes graphs ideal for well-understood processes but less suited for exploratory or creative work.\nMeta-Agents: Flexible Coordination Meta-agents are single agents equipped with tools that allow them to think about thinking – they can dynamically generate other agents, orchestrate workflows, and engage in recursive problem-solving. They represent the ultimate expression of the model-driven approach: agents that can self-architect their own coordination techniques.\nThink of a meta-agent as a senior architect who can not only solve a problem but also decide how to structure the problem-solving approach. When faced with a complex challenge, it might reason: “This requires both deep research and creative synthesis. I should generate a swarm of specialists and then use a graph to ensure the final deliverable meets quality standards.”\nfrom strands import Agent\nfrom strands_tools import graph, swarm, use_agent, think, workflow\nmeta_agent = Agent(\nsystem_prompt=\u0026quot;You can dynamically create specialized agents and orchestrate complex workflows.\u0026quot;,\rtools=[graph, swarm, use_agent, think, workflow]\r)\nMeta-agents excel in dynamic systems that evolve over time. The key benefit is their added layer of dynamism – they can generate agents that weren’t pre-defined, evolve new tools for emergent needs, adapt their coordination strategies based on changing conditions, and evolve their problem-solving approach as they learn more about the domain.\nUnlike the other patterns where you pre-define agents and tools, meta-agents can create new specialists and custom-build tools on demand. Analyzing a new technology trend? The meta-agent can generate domain-specialist agents for legal implications, market dynamics, and technical feasibility – agents that didn’t exist until that specific need arose. It can also evolve specialized tools for data harvesting, analytical frameworks, or report formats tailored to that specific domain.\nThis dynamic agent and tool creation allows systems to grow and adapt rather than follow fixed patterns.\nBuilding confidence through evaluation The model-driven approach requires robust evaluation to build confidence that agents are performing as expected, especially as they are making autonomous decisions about tool usage and task coordination.\nSince model-driven agents make dynamic decisions instead of following pre-determined paths, evaluation becomes both more critical and more nuanced. You need to assess not just whether the agent got the right answer, but whether it made good decisions about how to approach the problem.\nThe model-driven approach has changed how we think about evaluation itself. Traditional testing with static datasets becomes insufficient when agents flexibly adjust their behavior. This shift demands new evaluation patterns that match the intelligence of the systems being tested.\nLLM judges provide a powerful method for evaluating agent responses at scale, but they must be carefully calibrated to align with end-user expectations. An LLM judge that prioritizes technical accuracy may overlook nuances that matter to real users, such as tone, helpfulness, or practical applicability.\nLLM-driven simulated users allow for dynamic testing with evolving datasets, generating realistic interaction patterns that static test cases cannot capture. However, these simulated users must also be calibrated to behave like genuine end-users instead of idealized test scripts. The goal is authentic user behavior, not perfect user behavior.\nKey evaluation aspects for model-driven agents include:\nTool choice appropriateness – Did the agent select the right tool for the job?\nReasoning quality – Was the agent’s approach logical?\nAdaptability – How well did the agent handle unexpected situations?\nEfficiency – Did the agent complete the task without unnecessary steps?\nThe non-deterministic nature of model-driven agents means you need statistically meaningful baselines and continuous evaluation to track performance over time. This investment in evaluation allows you to confidently deploy agents that make autonomous decisions.\nThe paradigm shift: From rigid control to dynamic adaptation The model-driven approach represents a fundamental shift in how we think about AI agents. Instead of trying to control every facet of agent behavior through complex orchestration, we provide the right tools, context, and goals, and then let the model dynamically determine the best approach on its own.\nThis shift solves a core problem: pre-defined logic struggles to handle an unpredictable world. Traditional frameworks break when users ask questions in unexpected ways, when APIs return unforeseen responses, or when business requirements change. They fail because they can only handle the situations developers anticipated and programmed.\nModel-driven agents can adapt. When an API call fails, they reason about alternatives. When a user asks something unexpected, they figure out how to help using the available tools. When requirements change, they adjust their approach without code changes. This adaptability comes from leveraging the model’s reasoning capabilities instead of fighting against them.\nThe approach adopted in Strands allows agents to handle shifting demands and data while reducing the complexity developers need to manage. You can have both: the simplicity to get started fast and the power to configure everything when production demands it.\nThe model-driven approach is not about building better orchestration frameworks. It’s about realizing that modern LLMs have evolved beyond the need for such rigid guidance. By leveraging the model’s reasoning to orchestrate, we can build agents that are both more capable and easier to develop. This philosophy is the foundation on which everything else in Strands is built. Visit the Strands Agents website to try it today.\nLooking for more open source content?
