The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has entered an exhilarating new phase, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) is empowering partners to lead this transformation. Today, we’re excited to announce the launch of our new **agentic AI module** within the [AWS Partner Transformation Program (PTP),](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/programs/partner-transformation/) designed to accelerate partners’ capabilities in building autonomous AI solutions. This strategic initiative comes at a crucial time, as number of enterprise applications incorporating agentic AI continues to surge, presenting unprecedented opportunities for innovation in the public sector and beyond.

However, as with any transformative technology, many organizations find themselves asking the same question: How do we move from big ideas to practical execution using agentic AI? That’s why the new PTP module features two carefully crafted pathways tailored to meet partners where they are in their agentic AI journey. The **Foundational Path** is designed for partners beginning their agentic AI journey, providing strategic insights and guided use case development that culminates in a functional proof-of-concept. For partners ready to move into production, the **Solution Development Path** offers accelerated technical implementation leveraging powerful AWS services including [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/?refid=6da207ce-1440-41a4-b16f-3003bf7e4833), [Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com/latest/?refid=6da207ce-1440-41a4-b16f-3003bf7e4833), and other technologies leading to production-ready minimum viable products (MVPs) that deliver immediate value to customers. AWS Partners can also publish completed solutions to the [AI Agent & Tools solution page](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/solutions/ai-agents-and-tools/?ams%23interactive-card-vertical%23pattern-data.filter=%257B%2522filters%2522%253A%255B%255D%257D) in AWS Marketplace.

“AWS Partners are continuing to drive rapid AI adoption in public sector. With this new PTP module, we’re not just sharing technology, we’re providing a blueprint to accelerate AWS Partner offerings in the agentic AI space,” said Mike Cannady, director of partner core for public sector at AWS.

Partners participating in the program gain access to an extensive suite of resources, including exclusive workshop content, implementation support from AWS experts, sandbox credits for development, and comprehensive guidance for AWS Marketplace listing.

At the heart of this initiative is the comprehensive portfolio of AWS agentic AI services, such as [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/?refid=6da207ce-1440-41a4-b16f-3003bf7e4833), [Amazon Q](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/build/?refid=6da207ce-1440-41a4-b16f-3003bf7e4833), [AWS Transform](https://aws.amazon.com/transform/?refid=6da207ce-1440-41a4-b16f-3003bf7e4833), [Strands Agents,](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-strands-agents-1-0-production-ready-multi-agent-orchestration-made-simple/) and [Amazon Nova Act](https://labs.amazon.science/blog/nova-act?refid=6da207ce-1440-41a4-b16f-3003bf7e4833). These powerful tools enable partners to build sophisticated AI agents that can understand, decide, and act autonomously while maintaining the highest standards of security and compliance—crucial requirements for public sector implementations.

“Building off the excitement of the [AWS Summit New York City](https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/new-york/), we are making AWS the best place for the world’s most useful agents. PTP brings technical enablement to empower our partners to create agentic experiences that fundamentally transform how the public sector serves its citizens,_”_ shared Alex Martinez, director of public sector, partner solutions architecture at AWS.

The potential applications are transformative: from AI agents that optimize government operations and enhance citizen services to systems that revolutionize healthcare delivery and educational experiences. As organizations worldwide seek to harness these capabilities, AWS Partners are uniquely positioned to lead this next wave of innovation, backed by the most comprehensive and secure cloud platform for AI development.

Building on the AWS commitment to partner success, the new PTP module delivers a robust framework of structured approaches, best practices, governance, and guardrails—enabling partners to accelerate development cycles, minimize risks, and unlock the full potential of agentic AI solutions.

Partners interested in joining this new module can contact their AWS Partner account manager or partner development manager to learn more about the [PTP program](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/programs/partner-transformation/) and begin their agentic AI journey. The future of AI is agent-based, secure, and built on AWS—and our partners are at the forefront of this exciting transformation.
