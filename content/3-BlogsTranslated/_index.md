### [Blog 1 - AWS Weekly Roundup: Strands Agents](3.1-Blog1/)

This blog introduces the AWS Weekly Roundup from September 15, 2025, highlighting major AWS announcements and launches. It features Strands Agents, the open-source AWS SDK for agentic AI, which has reached 1 million downloads and 3,000+ GitHub Stars less than 4 months since launching as a preview in May 2025. The article covers recent AWS announcements including Amazon EC2 M4 and M4 Pro Mac instances, LocalStack integration in VS Code, AWS CDK Refactor, and more. It also highlights upcoming AWS events including the AI Agent Global Hackathon and AWS Gen AI Lofts worldwide.

### [Blog 2 - Build next-gen AI agents](3.2-Blog2/)

This blog announces the launch of a new agentic AI module within the AWS Partner Transformation Program (PTP), designed to accelerate partners' capabilities in building autonomous AI solutions. The article explores two carefully crafted pathways for partners at different stages of their agentic AI journey: the Foundational Path for partners beginning their journey, and the Solution Development Path for partners ready to move into production. It covers the comprehensive portfolio of AWS agentic AI services, including Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, Amazon Q, AWS Transform, Strands Agents, and Amazon Nova Act, enabling partners to build sophisticated AI agents with highest standards of security and compliance.

### [Blog 3 - Strands Agents and the Model-Driven Approach](3.3-Blog3/)

This blog explores the model-driven approach that Strands Agents SDK has adopted to eliminate the fragility of traditional orchestration frameworks. Instead of trying to anticipate and program for every possible scenario, modern large language models self-steer their behavior, making intelligent decisions about tool usage and adapting flexibly to situations. The article explains how this approach emerged from real-world production experience building agents for Kiro, Amazon Q Developer, and AWS Glue. It covers the agent loop concept, which is a natural cycle of reasoning and action that mirrors how intelligent systems think and work, allowing models to reason dynamically and handle edge cases better than traditional state machines.
