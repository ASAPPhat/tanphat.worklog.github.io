### Key Content Highlights

#### AI-Driven Software Development Lifecycle (AI-Driven SDLC)

- **Paradigm Shift**: Transition from traditional development processes to deep AI integration at every stage of software development lifecycle
- **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks in the development cycle, including code writing, testing, and deployment
- **Efficiency Enhancement**: Optimize time and resources through support from intelligent AI assistants, allowing developers to focus on complex business problems

#### Real-world Demonstration of Amazon Q Developer

- **Programming Assistant**: Demonstrate code suggestion capabilities, explain complex code logic, and automatically generate unit tests
- **Troubleshooting**: Guide using Amazon Q for debugging and proposing technical solutions to issues in real-time
- **Integration**: How to integrate Amazon Q into Integrated Development Environments (IDE) and developers' daily workflows

#### Kiro Tool Demonstration

- **Tool Capabilities**: Introduction to core features of Kiro (related to Kiro IDE/Agent)
- **Use Cases**: Live demonstration of how Kiro is used to solve specific programming problems in practice
- **Developer Experience**: Significantly improve developer experience through intuitive interface and intelligent features of Kiro

### What I Learned

#### Tooling Landscape

- **Amazon Q Developer** is not just a simple chat tool but a comprehensive assistant supporting every phase of SDLC
- **Kiro** brings new approaches and innovation in supporting development environments (IDE/Agent)

#### Productivity Optimization

- Applying **AI-Driven SDLC** helps minimize manual work, allowing developers to spend more time solving core business logic
- Developers need to proactively learn and master new AI tools to maintain competitive capabilities in technology trends

---

### Application to Work

- **Integrate Amazon Q**: Pilot Amazon Q Developer in current projects to leverage code review support and test generation capabilities
- **Research Kiro**: Spend time studying Kiro more deeply after the demo to evaluate integration capabilities and application to team processes
- **Improve SDLC**: Review current development process, identify bottlenecks, and plan using AI to automate those areas

---

### Event Experience

The workshop focused deeply on **technical demonstrations**, providing intuitive and convincing insight into the power of advanced programming support tools.

#### Practical Perspective

- **Toan Huynh**'s presentation helped me clearly envision how an AI-optimized and operated SDLC would look in practice
- **My Nguyen**'s Kiro demo was very specific and practical, highlighting the potential of emerging tools alongside major platforms like AWS

#### Impact on Work Process

- I clearly see that AI is fundamentally changing how we build software: faster, more accurate, and with fewer errors
- The event was concise but substantial, getting straight to strategic tools that the programming community cares about
- Overall, the afternoon session was a perfect complement to the architecture knowledge learned, helping complete the picture of modern software development
