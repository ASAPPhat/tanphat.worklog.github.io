During my internship at **AWS** from **September 8, 2025** to **December 19, 2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.  
I participated in **developing the InsightHR-1 application, an HR support tool**, through which I improved my skills in **programming, AI application, AWS services, and back-end coding**.

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.
