> Here, I freely share my personal opinions about my experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program, to help the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:

### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentor and team admin are always ready to answer questions and provide suggestions for my inquiries. The information and suggestions provided are very detailed and aligned with my concerns. People not only guide me but also encourage me to explore other approaches.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
Most of the work assigned to me is quite new compared to what I've learned so far, so I have the opportunity to learn additional knowledge that I had not explored before. The knowledge provided helps complete the project and improve the knowledge I learned at school.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me better plan my career path.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The admin and mentors are always cheerful and willing to chat with me about various topics from general matters to technical subjects. I'm also exposed to work stories and knowledge through workshops. When I made mistakes at first, I was reminded of shortcomings or misconceptions in my knowledge, helping me gain experience.
